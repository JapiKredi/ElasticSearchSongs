Title: Exploring the Future of Music Information Retrieval: A Guide to Vector Search for Audio Data

In this article, published on August 16, 2023, Alex Salgado delves into the exciting realm of music information retrieval, showcasing the fusion of machine learning, vector databases, and audio data analysis. This guide is tailored for those intrigued by music data analytics and eager to understand how technology is reshaping the music industry.

The central theme revolves around vector search, a method that opens up new possibilities for searching music data. With more than 80% of the world's data being unstructured, it becomes crucial to explore approaches beyond traditional text-based methods.

The article introduces a fascinating concept: the ability to search for music by humming a tune. The key player in achieving this feat is the use of embeddings â€“ numeric representations of audio generated by models trained on extensive audio datasets. The author details the architecture designed to enable this feature, emphasizing the role of embeddings in facilitating efficient searches in the embedded space.

To create audio embeddings, the article recommends using the librosa open-source Python package. The process involves extracting meaningful features from audio files, such as Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), chroma, and mel-scaled spectrogram features. These features collectively contribute to creating a high-dimensional vector that captures essential characteristics of the audio clip.

The implementation of audio search with Elasticsearch is then outlined in a step-by-step manner. The article guides readers through the process of creating an Elasticsearch index, populating it with audio data, and visualizing the results in Kibana, a powerful interface for interacting with Elasticsearch clusters.

The Python code snippets provided showcase the creation of an Elasticsearch index with specific configurations for storing vector representations or embeddings of audio files. The article emphasizes the importance of Elasticsearch version 8.8.0 or later for accommodating an embedding dimensionality of 2048.

Moving on, the author explains the process of selecting and ingesting audio data into Elasticsearch. A Python function is introduced to list audio files in a specified directory, and the power of embeddings for vector search is underscored as the magic behind the search mechanism.

The article then takes a deep dive into the crucial step of extracting audio features, including MFCCs, chroma features, and spectral contrast. The use of libraries like librosa for converting audio files into suitable formats and extracting features is highlighted. The panns_inference Python library, designed for audio tagging and sound event detection, is introduced for generating embeddings.

With all the necessary components in place, the article proceeds to demonstrate the insertion of audio data into Elasticsearch. A Python function is provided to store songs along with their embeddings, titles, timestamps, paths, and genres in the Elasticsearch index.

The article concludes by showcasing the visualization of results in Kibana and introduces the exciting prospect of searching for music based on an input audio file. The code generates an embedding for the input audio, queries Elasticsearch for similar embeddings, and presents the results, including relevant details such as paths, genres, and titles of similar songs.

The author acknowledges the experimental nature of the presented code and highlights the need for additional data and fine-tuning for deploying it in a production environment. The Probabilistic Auditory Neural Network (PANN) used in the audio tagging process requires further refinement for real-world effectiveness. The article concludes by recognizing the challenges and potential avenues for future research at the intersection of machine learning and auditory cognition, particularly in optimizing models for query by humming.
